# Terminal & Command Line
## ðŸ”¹the terminal

- The terminal is like **a screen where you can type and interact with the computer using text commands** instead of clicking buttons.
- Think of it as **a chatbox** where you give orders to your computer.
## ðŸ”¹ The Command Line (CLI - Command Line Interface)

- The command line is **the actual place where commands are executed** inside a terminal.
- The **CLI is the program running inside the terminal** that understands what you type.
- Example CLIs:
    1. **Command Prompt (`cmd`)**
    2. **PowerShell (`powershell`)**
    3. **Bash (`bash`)** on Linux/macOS

ps: Yes, people sometimes **call the CLI a "terminal" casually**, but technically, the **CLI is a program running inside the terminal*.
# PowerShell & Command Prompt
- `cmd` is like an **old Nokia phone**â€”it can call and text but lacks advanced features.
- PowerShell is like a **modern smartphone**â€”it can do everything an old Nokia can, but **also browse the web, run apps, and automate tasks**.

**PowerShell is better than `cmd` in almost every way**â€”so you should use PowerShell whenever possible!
# As for Docker
1. **You must use a terminal** to interact with Docker.
2. You can use **PowerShell or Command Prompt**, but **PowerShell is recommended** because it's more powerful.
3. On **Linux/macOS**, use **Bash** instead.
# As for Scoop
1. **Scoop only works in PowerShell**, not in `cmd`.
2. **Scoop only works in Windows.

# In Short
1. The **command line (CLI)** is inside the **terminal**, but people casually mix up the terms.
2. **PowerShell is better than Command Prompt (`cmd`)** and supports scripting.
3. **Docker can be used in PowerShell, Command Prompt, or Bash**, but PowerShell is recommended on Windows.
4. **Scoop only works in PowerShell**â€”not in Command Prompt!
